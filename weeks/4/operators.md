# Relational and Compound Operators

C# provides various relational and compound operators to compare values and create complex conditions in your code. This guide offers an in-depth explanation of these operators.

## Relational Operators

Relational operators are used to compare two values and determine the relationship between them. They return a boolean result (`true` or `false`) based on the comparison.

### Equality `(==)`

- Description: Checks if two values are equal.
- `Example:`

```csharp
  int x = 5;
  int y = 5;
  bool areEqual = x == y; // True enough
```

### Inequality `(!=)`

- Description: Checks if two values are not equal.
- `Example:`

```csharp
int a = 5;
int b = 10;
bool notEqual = a != b; // True enough
```

### Greater Than ``(>)``

- Description: Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
- `Example:`

```csharp
int num1 = 10;
int num2 = 5;
bool isGreaterThan = num1 > num2; // True enough
```

### Less Than ``(<)``

- Description: Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
- `Example:`

```csharp
int p = 3;
int q = 8;
bool isLessThan = p < q; // True enough
```
