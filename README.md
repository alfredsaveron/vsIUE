## Course Content

This course covers a wide range of programming topics, including:

- Basics of C and C# programming languages
- Variables, data types, and operators
- Control structures: conditionals and loops
- Functions and modular programming
- Arrays and data structures
- Input and output operations
- Error handling and debugging
- Best coding practices and conventions
- Basic software development principles

## Programming Languages

The course focuses on two important programming languages: C and C#. These languages are chosen to provide a strong foundation in programming, as well as to familiarize students with low-level and high-level programming concepts.

- **C**: C is a low-level programming language that provides in-depth knowledge of memory management and system-level programming.
- **C#**: C# is a high-level language that introduces modern programming concepts, including object-oriented programming and the .NET framework.

## Code Examples

Throughout this repository, you will find code examples that illustrate the concepts covered in the course. These examples are designed to help you understand and practice programming techniques.
